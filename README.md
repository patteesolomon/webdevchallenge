  ** Description
  This was a web development internship assignment I got
  working on as soon as I saw the challenge online.
  This app creates a line in a sequence and the user
  can add as many lines to the canvas dynamically
  with the ability to input x, y coordinates from
  the center screen.
  You may add multiple lines and you may change
  the line width when desired.
